# Project Name

[Project Description: A template for integrating NEST, TypeScript, and Vue for web application development]

## Project Overview

Start with a brief introduction to the project. Explain the purpose and the problem it aims to solve. In this case, we want to create a template that integrates NEST (a Node.js framework), TypeScript, and Vue (a JavaScript framework) to build a web application. Mention any specific use cases or industries where this template can be applied.

## Project Objectives

- Create a template for building web applications using NEST, TypeScript, and Vue.
- Ensure seamless integration between these frameworks.
- Implement best practices and coding standards for maintainability and scalability.

## Target Audience

Specify the target audience for the template. Is it for web developers, startups, specific industries, or any other group of users? Understanding the audience will help in tailoring the project to their needs.

## Features and Requirements

- User authentication and authorization.
- RESTful API endpoints using NEST.
- Vue-based front-end components.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- Database integration.
- Testing and documentation requirements.

## Technology Stack

- NEST.js
- TypeScript
- Vue.js
